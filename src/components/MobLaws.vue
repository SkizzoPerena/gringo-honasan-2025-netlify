                    <v-expansion-panel-text class="text-body-2">
                        CARPER was enacted in 2009 to extend the implementation of the Comprehensive
                        Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) and introduce essential reforms aimed at improving the
                        livelihoods of agrarian reform beneficiaries. The law seeks to address issues related to
                        land distribution, tenure security, and agricultural productivity by providing additional
                        support services, such as access to credit, education, and infrastructure. CARPER emphasizes
                        the importance of sustainable agricultural practices and the empowerment of farmers through
                        skills training and capacity building. It also aims to resolve pending land disputes and
                        facilitate the distribution of remaining agricultural lands to ensure that the goals of
                        social justice and economic equity in the agricultural sector are met, ultimately
                        contributing to rural development and food security in the Philippines.

                        This aims to strengthen the country's capacity to manage disaster risks and
                        enhance resilience against natural hazards. The law establishes a comprehensive framework
                        for disaster risk reduction and management at all levels of government, emphasizing
                        proactive measures rather than reactive responses. It mandates the creation of local

                        plans, and the integration of disaster risk management into development planning. The Act
